                                <td>Two orphan kids, Andi and Bruce, have a dog named Friday. However, their foster parents (Lois and Carl) do not approve of pets and do not appear to care for the kids. Hence, they have to keep Friday a secret which leads to Friday mainly living off the streets. One day, the kids found an abandoned hotel while looking for Friday. In the hotel lived two other dogs which the kids named. Georgia and Lenny. They decided to use the hotel to hide the dogs. Eventually they started taking in more strays and abandoned dogs. Unfortunately they were found out by their foster parents. The foster parents called the police, leading to all the dogs to be brought to the pound and arranged to be put down the next day. Carl and Lois refuses to foster Andi and Bruce anymore and thus, they are both separated in different orphanages. Friday manages to break out of the pound and found Dave, Heather, and Mark, who, in turn, found Andi and Bruce. They decided to break all the dogs out and try to get them past the city line so that they will be safe. However, Friday leads all the dogs back to the hotel as Friday sees the hotel as his home. This strange event (of hundreds of dogs running for the city line) attracted members of the public to follow the dogs to the hotel. Bernie (a social worker who have been looking out for the kids) introduces all the dogs and their stories to the public, winning over the public. In the end Bernie adopted the kids and the hotel is reopened as a hotel for dogs where people can adopt the stray dogs or board their dogs.</td>
